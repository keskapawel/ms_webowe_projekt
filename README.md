# Development

## Assets Source

* **SASS/PostCSS** files are located under `src/scss/`
* **JavaScript** files with support of latest ECMAScript _ES6 / ECMAScript 2016(ES7)/ etc_ files are located under `src/js/`
* **Image** files are located under `src/images/`
* **Font** files are located under `src/fonts/`
* **HTML** files are located under `src/templates/`
  * It will **automatically** build **all HTML files** placed under `src/templates/` directory, no need to manually configure each template anymore!

## Build Assets

### One time build assets for development

```sh
$ npm run build
```

### Build assets and enable source files watcher

```sh
$ npm run watch
```

This command is suitable if you develop with external web server.

> **Note:** File watching does not work with *NFS* (*Windows*) and virtual machines under *VirtualBox*. Extend the configuration in such cases by:

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  watchOptions: {
    poll: 1000 // Check for changes every second
  }
};
```

### Start a development server - reloading automatically after each file change.

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

# Production 

## Build Assets

```sh
$ npm run production
```
